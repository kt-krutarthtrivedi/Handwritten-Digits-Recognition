# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition

## Problem Statement

Apply various unsupervised learning techniques to the handwritten digits dataset and compare their performances based on the confusion matrix and Fowlkes-Mallows index.

## Dataset

[Handwritten Digits](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Optical+Recognition+of+Handwritten+Digits)

We used preprocessing programs made available by NIST to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. From a total of 43 people, 30 contributed to the training set and different 13 to the test set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.

## Results
